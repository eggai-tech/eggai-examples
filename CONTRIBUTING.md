## How Can I Contribute?

### Bug Reports
1. Check if the bug has already been reported in the [Issues](https://github.com/eggai-tech/eggai/issues) section.
2. Create a new issue and include:
   - A clear and descriptive title.
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   - Expected and actual results.
   - Relevant logs, screenshots, or error messages.

### Feature Requests
1. Review the [Issues](https://github.com/eggai-tech/eggai/issues) section to see if your idea has already been proposed.
2. Create a new issue and describe:
   - The problem your feature solves.
   - The proposed solution.
   - Alternatives you've considered.

### Code Contributions
1. Look for `good first issue` or `help wanted` tags in the [Issues](https://github.com/eggai-tech/eggai/issues).
2. Discuss your plans in the issue before starting work.
3. Fork the repository and work on a feature branch.

## Development Workflow

We have a Makefile at the root of the project that simplifies common development tasks. It's the recommended way to work with the project.

### Option 1: Using the Makefile (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eggai-tech/eggai.git
   cd eggai
   ```

2. Install all dependencies (SDK, docs, examples):
   ```bash
   make install
   ```
   
   Or install specific components:
   ```bash
   # Install only SDK dependencies
   make install-sdk
   
   # Install only documentation dependencies
   make install-docs
   
   # Install dependencies for a specific example
   make install-example EXAMPLE=multi_agent_conversation
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```bash
   # Run all tests with summary
   make test-all
   
   # Run SDK tests only
   make test-sdk
   
   # Run tests for a specific example
   make test-example EXAMPLE=multi_agent_conversation
   ```

4. Clean up:
   ```bash
   # Clean Python cache files
   make clean
   
   # Deep clean (removes virtual environments as well)
   make deep-clean
   ```

### Option 2: SDK Development (Alternative)

If you prefer to work directly in the SDK directory:

1. Navigate to the SDK directory:
   ```bash
   cd sdk
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
3. Run SDK tests:
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest
   ```

### Option 3: Example Project Development

If you're working on a specific example:

1. Navigate to the example directory:
   ```bash
   cd examples/multi_agent_conversation
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run example-specific setup (if available):
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
